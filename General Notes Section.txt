General Notes Section

Loop Invariant :	a predicate (predicate - a sentence with some variable and when specific values are inserted in the var's place, 
					we get a statement) that is true at the start and the end of every iteration of the loop.

					Used to show the correctness of an algorithm. Three things need to be shown about a loop invariant :

					1. Initialization : the invariant is true before the first iteration of the loop
					2. Maintenance : It is true before every iteration of the loop (this means that it is also true after every iteration)
					3. Termination : When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us an useful property that helps show the correctness
									 of the algorithm

1.1 Real valued functions and their graphs 

Definition about the graph of a function - Let f be a real-valued function of a real variable. The graph of f is the set of all points (x,y) in the Cartesian plane with the following properties :

	- x is in the domain of f
	- y = f(x)
